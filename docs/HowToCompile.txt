Because Visual Studio becomes a turtle when there are many little projects, I didn't set up dependencies between them and didn't put them all into one workspace per application. These are more or less the base of everything, build them in this order first:
1. deccs
2. dsutil
3. ui
4. subpic
5. subtitles
6. filters (for mpc only build those configurations which output a lib, the rest outputs stand-alone filters)

Required SDKs:
- DirectX 9 SDK (you may need to add "Debug Unicode" and "Release Unicode" configs to the project file of the directshow baseclasses)
- Platform SDK
- Windows Media Format SDK 9

It is recommended that you add DX9's include and lib paths to Visual Studio before the others:

- include:
<DXSDK>\Samples\C++\DirectShow\BaseClasses
<DXSDK>\Include
...

- lib:
<DXSDK>\lib
...

Other external header files are included directly, modify the path in the sources if your installation differs. (but don't COMMIT it to the SVN!)

Debug builds use dynamic, Release builds use static linking to standard C/C++ and MFC libs. Don't forget to change this in the baseclasses. Also IMPORTANT: add winmm.lib to the baseclasses or else you will get a few unresolved externals later.
