dirac_0.5.0
===========
  - Added C interface for the encoder application. Refer to the api 
    documentation in dirac_encoder.h or in the Programmer's Guide at
	http://dirac.sourceforge.net/documentation/code/programmers_guide/index.htm
  - Updated bitstream version. Encoder/Decoder apps in this release will not
    be able to decode bitstreams generated by earlier versions.
  - Improvements to Constant Quality encoding engine to improve stability.
  - Speed-ups to motion compensation and wavelet transform for faster decoding
  - Removed rounding errors from motion compensation.
  - Fixed bugs with clipping and encoding black or white areas.
  - Fixed bug with overflow in context modelling for arithmetic coding of 
    HD pictures.
  - Added unit tests for motion compensation classes and wavelet classes.
  - The number of frames parameter is no longer required. All existing picture
    header files must be recreated using make_header for this parameter to be
    omitted. Otherwise, incorrect bit rates will be reported by the encoder
    application.
  - Updated algortihm documentation.
  - Restructured libraries so that only two libraries are generated - an encoder
    library and a decoder library. 'make install' will now install only the 
    public API libraries and header files, the encoder and decoder apps and the
    conversion and instrumentation utilities.
  - Added support for building shared and/or static libraries using libtool
    under UNIX, GNU/Linux.  Shared and static libraries are built by default.
  - Added support for building shared or static libraries under MS Windows
    using MSYS and the no cost MSVC++ 2003 toolkit. Shared libraries are built
    by default.
  - Added support for building the codec using MS Visual C++ .NET 2003 under
    MS Windows. Options are available to build Dlls and static libraries. 
    The _declspec mechanism is used to export the Encoder and Decoder public 
    "C" API.
  - New target 'valgrind-check' added to make under Linux.
  - Build under MS Windows using nmake no longer supported.
  - Bug fixes: 1050816, 1055692, 1050757, 1044503, 1044501, 1044499
  - Patches Applied: 1055714, 1055707, 1061923, 1071429, 1059342

dirac-0.4.3
===========
  - Quality metric has changed from PSNR to one based on 4th powers of errors.

  - Fixed bug in diagnostics tool in handling input with 4:1:1 chroma format.
  - Updated algorithm documentation

dirac-0.4.2
===========
  - Fixed bugs in writing instrumentation data while encoding which
    caused the diagnostics tool to go into an infinite loop
  - Fixed bug in diagnostic tool when handling reference 2 and only
    one reference frame is available
  - Number of frames in encoded output header is now set correctly to
    the number of frames encoded.
  - Fixed bug with bit-rate being miscalculated when only a section of the 
    sequence is encoded.
  - Fixed bug with setting DC band perceptual weight.

dirac-0.4.1
===========
  - Added support for build under Microsoft Windows using gnu autotools,
    MSYS and no-cost MS VC++ 2003 compiler

  - Fixed bug in building unit tests when older versions of cppunit are 
    installed

  - Fixed bugs in measurement of PSNR and motion estimation process

dirac-0.4.0
===========
  - Added constant quality encoding interface using PSNR
     as the quality measure, and using multi-pass frame
     coding
  - Added Intra-frame insertion and cut detection
  - Added C interface for the decoder application to allow
     interfacing to player software. Refer to the api documentation
     in dirac_parser.h.
  - Implemented unique frame headers to facilitate bit-stream
     parsing
  - Added instrumentation output from encoder and an 
     instrumentation display tool for visualising encoder
     decisions to help with algorithmic development
  - Cleansed and refactored numerous code files to add comments,
     improve readability and modularity
  - Added a unit testing framework based on cppunit for testing
     classes 
  - Fixed bug with vertical block separation always being set
     to 8 pixels
  - Added feature to encode only a section of input video rather
     than the whole sequence
  - Tweaked motion estimation parameters to improve performance,
     mostly for higher-res pictures
  - Included document describing the syntax of Dirac bitstream v0.1
    in the doc directory.
  - Fixed bug 1008694 (Out-of-tree building fails)
  - Fixed header and pkconfig installation
