Dirac Documentation HOW-TO

by Scott Robert Ladd (scott.ladd@coyotyegulch.com)


The Dirac technical documentation comes in two forms:

1) Embedded API documentation that is extract via Doxygen to produce
   external documentation in HTML and LATEX formats.

2) A description of the Dirac Algorithms, maintained as a LATEX file
   that serves as the source code for PostScript, PDF, and HTML
   documents.
   
This document describes how to build the Dirac documentation, and lsist
the tools required for its creation.

Producing API Documentation with Doxygen
----------------------------------------

Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org) is an industry-standard program for
extracting documentation from specially-formatted source code. In
concept, Doxygen is similar to Java's Javadoc utility. Doxygen uses
the GraphViz (http://www.graphviz.org) package to produce professional
class diagrams from an analysis of the source code.

Use the following command to produce the documents with Doxygen:

    # doxygen dirac_api.doxygen
    
The above command generates three directories filled with documentation
in three formats: HTML, LATEX, and Unix man pages.

The HTML can simply be copied to any appropriate directory on a web
server for display.

To generate a final PDF file from the LATEX source, simply execute a
"make" command in the codec/doc/latex directory.


Producing the Dirac Algorithm document
--------------------------------------

The source for Dirac Algorithm document is a LATEX
(http://www.latex.org)
