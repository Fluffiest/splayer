In order to build this splitter the source of Bento4 has to be extracted into the AP4 directory.

Location: http://sourceforge.net/projects/bento4/

!!!IMPORTANT!!! 

There are a few necessary changes need to be done before it can be compiled. Just overwrite the original library files with what you can find at .\AP4\Update\<version>.

There are only project files for vc2k5b2 because I don't have vc2k3 anymore. So if you want to build with that you have to create them yourself. (just decreasing the version number of sln/vcproj works usually...)
